A method wrapped around Snakemake for swift, precise, and accurate detection of viral pathogens in single-cell
RNA (scRNA) datasets to investigate the possible correlation between viral pathogens and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Usage

> ***snakemake --cores 16 --use-conda --configfile config.yaml --latency-wait 60***
    
### Note
This is a developmental and alpha phase of the pipeline, upon completion a Python Wrapper will take care of every runtime parameter handling automatically.
